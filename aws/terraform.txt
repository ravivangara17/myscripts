Suppose we have a very simple, stateless web application. Here’s a simple one based on the Hello World application from Node’s Express framework:

	https://github.com/vivlabs/devops-hello-world

This has two configuration properties: the listener port and the “Hello world” message.

Implement a build system that constructs a deployable package for this code. 


https://github.com/vivlabs/devops-hello-world


resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami = "ami-2d39803a"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  
  user_data = <<-EOF
              #!/bin/bash
              echo "Hello, World" > index.html
              nohup busybox httpd -f -p 8080 &
              EOF
  tags {
    Name = "terraform-example"
  }
}

download from git and tar it
send the tar file via ansible/puppet

on the compute
untar, go to dir, npm install, npm run build , npm start
